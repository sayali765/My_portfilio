                            Experience with E-Cell Team as Team Lead
                            During my tenure as the E-Cell Team Lead, I had the privilege of leading a dynamic team of 18 members in the National Entrepreneurship Challenge (NEC) organized by IIT Bombay. Our journey started when our TPO (Training and Placement Officer) notified us via a student group message about a meeting the next day at 4:30 PM at the TP Seminar Hall. My classmates and I attended, where the TPO presented us with the choice of pursuing a startup or a job and introduced us to NEC, a prestigious 6-month competition with significant monetary rewards
                            Following the meeting, we were asked to introduce ourselves, which led to the formation of our team. I was honored to be appointed as the team lead and instructed to report at 9 AM the next day to define our roles. With only 2 days left to complete our tasks, we had to address 6 to 10 tasks in a high-pressure environment, working from 9 AM to 6:30 PM.
                            As team lead, I was responsible for managing updates, monitoring emails, and tracking task progress. Balancing this role with my internship and participation in the Smart India Hackathon 2023, I developed crucial skills in leadership, task management, and effective communication. This experience taught me the importance of staying calm, being patient, and fostering teamwork
                            Our hard work paid off as we achieved an all-India rank of 31 within 6 months. We later shared our experience with the college community and organized a successful post-event gathering. The positive feedback from juniors underscored our dedication.
                            This journey highlighted the significance of respecting each team member and understanding that building a strong team is a gradual process. I learned to inspire, encourage, and uplift my teammates, ensuring everyone had the opportunity to contribute and grow.
                            
                            Overall, this experience was a profound learning curve in leadership and team management, and I am proud of our team's achievements.

                            Firstly, I was really happy when our TPO shared that five of us were selected for the internship out of 25 people. I was able to secure my seat. Then, we were informed that the date was October 16, 2023, and I was delighted to learn that my mentor was Krunal, sir. He made me comfortable with all the IT stuff and gradually updated me. I feel that having the right mentor for our career is important, and I found that in him. I started with DBMS management system. As the exam approached, we decided to take a break. In January 2023, we started again, but now the game changed; as there were five of us, they formed us into a team and provided us with the CV fraud detection system.

                        <p class="small-para">
                            Firstly, we had to include all the colleges in India in our search. Users could type in "IIT" or
                             "Indian Institute," and we had to conduct the search accordingly. This took a little more time because the technologies mentioned were Java, Spring Boot, and for frontend, ReactJS, which were new to us. But as time went on, we were able to extract the email IDs, phone numbers, and other information from the resumes. However, some resume formats were different, so it took 2-3 days to figure out how to extract the names from them. Regarding phone numbers, there were 8 to 9 different formats, so we used regular expressions. Eventually, we were able to extract names, phone numbers, email IDs, college names, skills, and experiences. This is still a work in progress and will continue to grow.

                            What Happens When You Work with Dedication? Opportunities Come Your Way!

                            Here's a real-life example of how dedication can open doors to incredible opportunities. Recently, I crossed paths with my junior, Nishe Services. Yes, you heard that right! He was eager to grow his business but needed help with operations, social media presence, and employee management.
                            
                            We had an insightful conversation where he shared his concerns about hiring the right people for his company. He was worried about whether the employees he hired would be committed to their tasks and deliver within deadlines. I advised him that while hiring someone is essential, it's not just about filling a positionâ€”it's about ensuring that the person you bring on board is truly dedicated to your vision.
                        </p>
                        <p class="small-para">
                            I suggested creating documentation and a legal contract outlining expectations, salary increments, and reductions based on performance. This way, both parties are clear on their commitments. Start by hiring one employee and conducting regular performance reviews, like a Scrum analysis, to gauge whether your company is on track for success. As you gain confidence and see progress, you can gradually expand your team.

                            I also shared some tips and tricks on how to build a strong, committed team that aligns with your business goals. It's all about starting small, analyzing the outcomes, and then scaling up.
