<p>Hi, I'm Sayali Pathak, a final-year B.Tech student graduating in 2025. My journey over the past few years has been a blend of leadership, technical skills, and impactful experiences.

    **Leadership & Teamwork**
    For the past a years, I have had the privilege of leading a team of 17 members as the E-Cell Team Lead. Under my leadership, our team achieved an impressive rank of 31st in the National Entrepreneurship Challenge (NEC). This role honed my skills in teamwork, communication, public relations, and securing sponsorships. I learned the art of influencing and engaging stakeholders, which has been instrumental in building a strong network and delivering successful events.
    My role as the E-Cell Team Lead also involved delivering consultancy to small-scale companies, where I contributed to their growth and success.
    Internship Experience
    I interned at Vinz Global from October 2023 to June 2024. Initially, I focused on database management, gaining foundational knowledge. Later, from February to June 2024, I worked in a group of five on a proof-of-concept CV fraud detection system. My contributions included both front-end development and research, which allowed me to apply and expand my technical skills.
    **Technical Skills & Aspirations**
    I am passionate about becoming a full-stack developer. My portfolio showcases my proficiency in React.js, reflecting my commitment to developing robust and user-friendly applications.
    Personal Growth & Impact Throughout my journey, I have built strong connections with mentors, including Krunal Sir, CEO and Founder Vinay Sir, and Saumanya Mam,My who have guided and supported me. 
    I am grateful for the learning experiences and the opportunity to make a difference. As I approach the next chapter of my career, I am excited about leveraging my skills and experiences to continue making a meaningful impact.
